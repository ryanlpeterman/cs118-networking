## Problems and Solutions

## Acknowledgements of Code used
Aside from StackOverflow for small code examples, the main place I got code from was Beej's guide to networking. It provided examples on how to use getaddrinfo() and on how to use the socket system calls.

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Academic Integrity Note

You are encouraged to host your code in private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or other places.  At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Provided Files

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` are the entry points for the server and client part of the project.
